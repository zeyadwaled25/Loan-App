# Loan-App
The project is a web-based loan app built with React. It uses useState to manage a form with real-time validation (e.g., name length, phone format, age range). The form submits only when valid, with instant feedback via border colors. A success message appears upon submission. Built with Bootstrap, it offers a sleek, responsive design.
